# storageDesu OwO

storageDesu is a little project about a storage server where files aren't referenced on a list ( you need the link to access a file ) are automatically deleted 1 week after they were last accessed.

Basically, this is just a fork of [QuadFile](https://github.com/QuadPiece/QuadFile) rewritten in PHP

It's not complete, for now it only uploads the file to the server and registers it to the database. I still have to do the routing of URLs and the automatic cleaner which will be running everytime to delete old files.

The whole code you see here ( or the one in the first commit if you come from the future ) was written in less than an hour in a tired rush between 2am and 3am
